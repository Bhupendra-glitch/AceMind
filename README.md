# ♠️ PokerBot – Intelligent Poker Playing Bot

PokerBot is an AI-powered poker playing bot designed to analyze game states, evaluate hand strength, model opponents, and make strategic decisions automatically.  
This project starts with a rule-based system and can be extended to Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning.
